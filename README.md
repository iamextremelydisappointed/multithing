# CloudLink Golang
This is a *work-in-progress* port of CloudLink to the Go Programming Language!

## 💡 Features 💡

### 🪶 Even faster and more lightweight
CloudLink Golang can run on (abysmally) minimal resources. At least 10MB of RAM and a potato CPU can run a CloudLink Golang server!

### 📦 Minimal dependencies
Use `go mod tidy`.
